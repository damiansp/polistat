Pulls and organizes political data from <a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org">votesmart.org</a> using their API (see Resources). Currently just pulling data on US Senators.


## Ultimate Goals
- get bio data on all senators
- get voting history on all senators
- get data on campaign finance (primary sources of funding)
- create tools to inform voters on senators voting behavior and (ideally) the consequences thereof:
  - clustering to see how different senators compare with each other based on bio and/or voting behavior
- use the voting data to determine the "partisan-ness" of each bill
- use ML/NLP methods to summarize bills succinctly
- determine predictiveness of funding sources on voting behavior
- more TBD...
